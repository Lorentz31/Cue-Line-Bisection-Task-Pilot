# Cue-Line-Bisection-task-Pilot
This repository contains a Python file for the execution of my first experiment: the "Line Bisection Task Pilot". This experiment aims at detecting the ability and the accuracy of a human subject to stare at a horizontal line and press a key in correspondence of a white cue.
